# Large PDF Storage

This directory is for PDFs larger than 50MB that cannot be stored directly in GitHub.

## For Development
Place your large PDF files here during development. They will be ignored by Git.

## For Users
When using this system:
1. Place your own PDF files in the `data/documents/` directory
2. The system will automatically process all supported formats
3. Large files are processed efficiently using chunking strategies

## Note
The actual research PDFs used in development are not included in this repository 
to keep the download size manageable for users.
